This repo contains some customized [OpenWRT](https://openwrt.org/) firmwares for my routers.

## TP-Link WDR6500 v5

![Firmware Build Status](https://img.shields.io/azure-devops/build/expiron/6e0ba28b-6edf-4a7e-afa4-b7789d2d6068/34/master?style=flat-square&label=Firmware&logo=azure-pipelines)

The `01-ar71xx-add-support-for-tl-wdr6500v5-openwrt-19.07.patch` is inspired by Weijie Gao <hackpascal@gmail.com>.
The `diffconfig` is generated by `openwrt/scripts/diffconfig.sh` and simplified manually.
The `build.yml` and `template.yml` are used for Azure Pipelines.

Because of changes in mtd layout, this device model cannot be merged into the official OpenWRT
source repository ([#1389](https://github.com/openwrt/openwrt/pull/1389)). It is said that the
TL-WDR6500v2 device model in the official repo can also be used for the v5 model but only the 2.4G
WiFi works. This device model fixed the issue. And tested on my TL-WDR6500v5 router, both 2.4G WiFi
and 5G work perfectly using this model.
Additionally, porting this model to the ath79 target is in the future plan.

## Generic x86/64

This profile is built for testing.
The `diffconfig` is optimized for convenience and generated by `openwrt/scripts/diffconfig.sh`.
The `build.yml` and `template.yml` are used for Azure Pipelines.
